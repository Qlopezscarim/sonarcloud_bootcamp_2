//Syntax for importing ES Modules - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-an-es6-import-in-node-js/
import { Sequelize, Model, DataTypes } from '@sequelize/core';

/* Connect to your database 
  See: Sequalize Getting Started - Connecting to a database by passing a URI - Read: https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/#connecting-to-a-database
  Copy URI/URL string from ElephantSQL - under details. 
  Security Best Practice: Don't use the URL/URI string (postgres://username:password@hostname/databasename) directly in applciation code. Store the database URL as the API_URL environment variable within the .env file. 
  BAD Implementation - const sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://user:pass@example.com:5432/dbname') // Example for postgres
  Good Implementation - const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.API_URL);

/* Create your Sequalize Model for Listing */
/*Hint: Take a look at listings.json to figure out the model attributes we need to define.
  We are creating this model to define the format of our table.

  },
  coordinates: {

  },
  address: {

// `sequelize.define` also returns the model

/* Export the model to make it avaiable to other parts of your Node application */

//Export the model 'Listing' in a single statement at the end of the module
export { Listing };
